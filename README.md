Uses youtube-dl and eventually some script-fu to download MP3 files from YouTube, and process the filenames and tags to be more useful.

This script expects a file named 'list' containing a list of YT URLs. Eats anything yt-dl can, probably.

Included list is a few tracks from https://www.youtube.com/user/NoCopyrightSounds

A basic outline of what I hope to accomplish and the vague method we'll use is commented into ytdl.sh right now, hoping to get some more eyes on this.
