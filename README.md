Uses youtube-dl and some script-fu to download MP3 files from YouTube, and process the filenames and tags to be more useful.

This script expects a file named 'list' containing a list of YT URLs. Eats anything yt-dl can, probably.

Included list is a few tracks from https://www.youtube.com/user/NoCopyrightSounds
